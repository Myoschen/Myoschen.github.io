#  Welcome to My New Blog!

Hello everyone! My name is Ryan, and I am a frontend engineer specializing in developing websites using the Next.js framework and developing apps using Expo (React Native). I am passionate about frontend technologies and enjoy exploring new tools and techniques in my spare time.

# The Journey to This Blog

I previously created my blog using Gatsby, but it hasn't been maintained for quite some time. So, I decided to write my own blog template. Currently, I am using Next.js and Velite to build it.
